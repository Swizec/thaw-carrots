> Is there a node package I can run to warmup my laptop? I’m thawing some carrots and it’s taking too long

Problem, solved!

Run `thaw-carrots` with a temperature and this script will warm your CPU to just the right temperature and keep it there.

Frozen carrots? `thaw-carrots`

AC too strong? `thaw-carrots`

Cold hands? `thaw-carrots`

## Usage

Use npm or yarn to install globally

```
$ npm install -g thaw-carrots
```

Open a terminal and warm yourself up

```
$ thaw-carrots -t 90
```

You get a nice printout showing current temperature.

Enjoy. Never go cold again!
